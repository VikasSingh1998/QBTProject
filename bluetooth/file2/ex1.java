Subject: Keystone Verification Email Not Received

Hi Team,

I attempted to register my Qualcomm email (quic_viksi@quicinc.com) with Keystone, and the system indicated that a verification email was sent. However, I haven’t received any email, not even in spam or junk folders.

Please help check if there’s an issue with email delivery or my account setup.

Thanks,
Vikas Kumar
